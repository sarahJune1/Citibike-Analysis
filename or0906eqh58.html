<div>This project looks to understand how different user types of the New York City's bike share program enjoy their&nbsp;ride. Specifically, the trip duration comparing Subscribers and Customers when they unlock a bike from its station. The categories of user type are defined as follows: </div><div>Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member.</div><div></div><div>Our Hypothesis is that subscribers will take shorter distance ride compared to customers, who we assume are looking for a more leisurely and exploratory ride.</div>
