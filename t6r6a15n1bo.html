Customers pay a flat fee for the day, but must pay $4 more for each additional fifteen minutes after a 30 minute ride. Subscribers pay a flat monthly fee, but must pay an additional $2.50 for each extra fifteen minutes after a 45 minute ride. These incongruent payment structures may cause the data to have discontinuities at the 30 minute and 45 minute marks for Customers and Subscribers respectively.</div><div></div><div>A strength of our analysis is a clean-cut and simple analysis between two independent samples. The result is highly statistically significant and follows a simple logic.</div><div></div><div></div>
