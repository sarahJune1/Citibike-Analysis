<div>We were suggested by Mengyun Li in our peer review to use a&nbsp;z-test. This would have&nbsp;been appropriate if we were comparing one sample to its population.&nbsp; However, we want to compare two different samples (customers vs. subscribers).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Our other suggestion from our&nbsp;peer reviewer, Tanya Nabila, suggested a Pearson's test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we aren't looking for a relationship between the two variables. It is not sufficient for testing our hypothesis because this method would have tested for a&nbsp;linear relationship between the two samples. We are looking to ascertain the difference between the two groups.</div><div></div><div>Because of these reasons, we decided to implement a one-sided t-test. The data is parametric because it follows a t-distribution and is numerical, and we are looking for the difference between the two groups. We also set alpha to be 0.05.</div><div></div><div>Our results of the test are as follows:</div><div></div><div>The p-value from<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html" target="_blank"> the t-test of two independent samples</a>&nbsp;is approximately zero and the t-test statistic is positive. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the average trip duration is the same or longer for a sample of users that are Subscribers compared to Customers throughout the months of January and August. The test output is shown b</div><div></div><div><b>Conclusions -&nbsp;</b><b>The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis. Either this session of the previous one should contain figures as well to show the results.</b></div><div></div><div>Using the two-sample t-test, we found evidence, with a very high degree of significance, that Subscriber trip duration is shorter than Customer trip duration.</div><div></div><div>One weakness is Citibike's payment structure, which may artificially skew the distributions of our datasets. Customers pay a flat fee for the day, but must pay $4 more for each additional fifteen minutes after a 30 minute ride. Subscribers pay a flat monthly fee, but must pay an additional $2.50 for each extra fifteen minutes after a 45 minute ride. These incongruent payment structures may cause the data to have discontinuities at the 30 minute and 45 minute marks for Customers and Subscribers respectively.</div><div></div><div>A strength of our analysis is a clean-cut and simple analysis between two independent samples. The result is highly statistically significant and follows a simple logic.</div><div></div><div></div>
